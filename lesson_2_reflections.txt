How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
you can track mistakes.
you can compare youre progress
you can go back to something which worked in teh past

vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

Pros - it is logical - not too many and not too much
Cons - you may forget the right time - requires self disicpline
